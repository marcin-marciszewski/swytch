                <p>“Our mission is to make top-quality electric bike technology affordable for everyone. <br> We went to
                    great
                    lengths to design the product to be affordable, easy to fit, and universally compatible. <br>

                    We estimate 99% of the 1 Billion bicycles in the world could be converted with Swytch.<br>

                    Converting existing bikes is not only better for your piggy bank, but for the environment too, as it
                    saves
                    90%* of the CO2 emissions when compared to manufacturing a brand new eBike.”

                <p>“This new improved product is a game-changer for us, and our customers.<br> Based on feedback from
                    our
                    3,000
                    existing “Swytchers” we identified that the size of the original power pack was the main area for
                    improvement to make the kit more attractive to end users so that more people would “Make the
                    Swytch”.<br>
                    By upgrading the battery technology, and developing a custom-made super-compact motor control PCB we
                    have
                    managed to fit the same technology into a 70% smaller pack.<br> It’s now “hand-held” and will fit on
                    your
                    palm!
