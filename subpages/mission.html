                <p>“Our mission is to make top-quality electric bike technology affordable for everyone. <br> We went to
                    great
                    lengths to design the product to be affordable, easy to fit, and universally compatible. <br>

                    We estimate 99% of the 1 Billion bicycles in the world could be converted with Swytch.<br>

                    Converting existing bikes is not only better for your piggy bank, but for the environment too, as it
                    saves
                    90%* of the CO2 emissions when compared to manufacturing a brand new eBike.”
